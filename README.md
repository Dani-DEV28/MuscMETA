# List of things #
- Be sure to make a brach, do not edit in main <br>
    - `git branch [name]`
    - `git checkout [name]` <-to switch to the new branch
<br>
Afterward, you will be working on your own branch, which can be broken while `main` remains stable. You can optionally merge new features from the `main` branch.

**Instruction:**  

- `git branch` ‚Üê Check if you are on `main` or not  
- `git checkout [yourBranch]` ‚Üê Switch from `main` to the branch you made  
- `git fetch` ‚Üê Update all remote branches on your local machine  
- `git merge origin/main` ‚Üê Update your local branch with new changes from `main`  
- Then just:  
  ```bash
  git add .
  git commit -m "merge"
  git push origin [yourBranch]

- npx nodemon
    - This is for launching test enviroment to see changes
- setting up .env file
    - ``DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=1234
DB_NAME=music_meta
DB_PORT=3306
PORT=3000``

# Understand POST and GET #
- home button use the POST that way user data is passed along the URL

# Current Implementation #
- Back Button Code:
    `<button onclick="history.go(-1)">üîô Go Back</button>`

    `<link rel="stylesheet" href="/styles/style.css">`
- For Loop nest timecomplexity of O(n*m) -> need to late reduce time comp
- Page navi:
    ```<div id = headerTitle>
        <form action="/" method="post">
            <button type="submit" id = navi>üîô Go Home</button>
        </form>

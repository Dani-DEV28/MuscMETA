## What is MusicMETA?
- It intend to be an alternative interface for music database (DB) such as MusicBrainz
### How are we different?
- First all, unlike more well know DB. We are focus on giving user a cleaner and less clutter experience compare to more dated database websites.

## Branching Guidelines
- **Do not edit directly in `main`.** Always create a new branch.

### Create and Switch Branches
```bash
# Create a new branch
git branch [name]

# Switch to the new branch
git checkout [name]
```

### Keeping Your Branch Updated
```bash
# Check your current branch
git branch

# Switch from main to your branch
git checkout [yourBranch]

# Update all remote branches on your local machine
git fetch

# Merge the latest changes from main into your branch
git merge origin/main

# Add, commit, and push changes
git add .
git commit -m "merge"
git push origin [yourBranch]
```

## Agenda of Things Needed
- **CSS Styling:** Focus on mobile-first design
    - Three base colors: background, page wrapper, and font

- **SQL Database:**
    - Update the database to support image storage instead of links

- **UI and Pages to Implement:**
    - `Result.ejs` Page
    - `AlbumTrackList.ejs` Page
    - `SingleTrackInfo.ejs` Page

---

## User Interface
- Pass search input to search result pages
- Add a back button on every page except `Result.ejs`
- Display album covers in a grid layout
- Include a home button on every page except `Home.ejs`

## Build Commands
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install -y

# Launch test environment
npx nodemon
```

---

## Environment Setup
Create a `.env` file with the following content:
```plaintext
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=1234
DB_NAME=music_meta
DB_PORT=3306
PORT=3000
```
Replace the `DB_PASSWORD` with the password used to set up the database.

---

## Understand POST and GET
- The home button uses the POST method to pass user data along the URL.

---

## Current Implementation
- **Back Button Code:**
```html
<button onclick="history.go(-1)">ðŸ”™ Go Back</button>
```

- **CSS Link:**
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/styles/style.css">
```

- **Time Complexity:**
    - Nested loop complexity: O(n * m)
    - Consider refactoring to reduce time complexity

- **Page Navigation:**
```html
<div id="headerTitle">
    <form action="/" method="post">
        <button type="submit" id="navi">ðŸ”™ Go Home</button>
    </form>
    <h2>Album Track List</h2>
    <button onclick="history.go(-1)" id="navi">ðŸ”™ Go Back</button>
</div>
```

## TROUBLE SHOOTING TIPS

- Issues with loading `npx nodemon` for Windows users
### error example in VS terminal
```html
Emitted 'error' event on Server instance at:
    at emitErrorNT (node:net:1948:8)
    at process.processTicksAndRejections (node:internal/process/task_queues:90:21) {
  code: 'EADDRINUSE',
  errno: -4091,
  syscall: 'listen',
  address: '::',
  port: 3000
}
```
- To resolve the issues on Windows PowerShell and excute the following code:
```html
netstat -ano | findstr :3000
<!-- This should result  in table -->
TCP    0.0.0.0:3000           0.0.0.0:0              LISTENING       20168
TCP    [::]:3000              [::]:0                 LISTENING       20168
<!-- In this table, look for the number after listing and excute the following -->
taskkill /PID [Number after LISTENING] /F 
```
- Now you should be able to run `npx nodemon`

- Multiple instance of `npx nodemon` running, causing issues
    - Enter Window PowerShell and run the `taskkill /IM node.exe /F` to end all instances of node.exe
